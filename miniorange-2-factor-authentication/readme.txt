 == Frequently Asked Questions ==


 = What happens if I enable 2FA for all users, but a user hasn’t registered yet? =

 Users who haven’t set up 2FA will be prompted to configure their authentication method during their next login. This ensures account security without locking them out.


 = How do I enable Google Authenticator as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as the backup method? =

 Yes, you can configure Google Authenticator as a backup method by enabling **"Login with any configured 2FA method"** or **Multi-Factor Authentication** from the plugin settings.
 Note: This is a Premium Feature.


 = Can I limit users to only one authentication method? =

 Yes. In the **Quick Setup** tab, select the desired 2FA method (e.g., Google Authenticator). During registration or login, users will only see the method(s) you’ve enabled.
 Note: This is a Premium Feature.


 = How can I maintain the same look and feel on my custom login page when using 2FA? =

 If you're using a custom login page (other than wp-login.php), go to the Login Form Settings in the plugin dashboard and configure 2FA for your specific form.
 Note: Some custom forms may require additional integration. If 2FA doesn’t work out of the box, reach out via the Support tab in the plugin or email us at info@xecurify.com for custom integration help.


 = What should I do if the 2FA plugin conflicts with another plugin or prevents login? =

 Our plugin is compatible with most major plugins, but occasional conflicts may occur. If you face any issues:

 = How do I transfer my 2FA setup to a new phone?  =

 Go to the **Setup 2FA** tab under **My Account**, and simply reconfigure your preferred 2FA method on your new device.


 = How do I regain access to my site if I get locked out using Google Authenticator (2FA)? =

 If you're locked out, here are a few recovery options:
 >* **Login with another admin account**(that doesn’t have 2FA enabled).
 >* **Use Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA** if previously configured as a backup method.
 >* **Disable the plugin via FTP:** Rename the plugin folder from your hosting file manager or FTP. This will deactivate the 2FA plugin and allow access without verification.
